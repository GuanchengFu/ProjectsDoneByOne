The user possible have two ways to interact with the text editor:
1. Using the cursor for
    -- Changing the size of the current windows.
    -- Changing the position of the cursors.


2. Using the keyboard for
    -- Input characters
    -- Undo and redo and other shortcuts




Cursor design: Basically, the user has two possibly ways to interact with the cursor.

The first way is using the keyboard: When the user input a character, delete a character,
the cursor should move accordingly.

In this situation, it should interact with the KeyEventHandler to get the information about which key
is pressed.

The second way is using the mouse, the cursor should move to the position where it was clicked.

In this situation, it should interact with the MouseClickEventHandler.


Possible design for
public class CursorTracker {
    private static cursorPos;    //Keep Track of the cursor position using this variable.

}
